## What is this web app about :question:
This app is a To do list where you can register all the things that you have to do. This app is very focused to **people that manage their time** very well.

## What technologies did I use :question:
In this app I used mongo DB as a database where I connect this with API REST with node js and express. Overmore, I used Angular 8 to build the front end and I used **sockets** to maintain a real time connection with the backend

## What I learn in this project :question:
Something that I learn when I was developing this app was about how to develop a project where I had to implement sockets connections with node. Another thing that I learn was about deploying an app that uses sockets to the **cloud server** with heroku and github pages.
